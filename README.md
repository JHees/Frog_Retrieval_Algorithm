# FROG Retrieval Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements a Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) retrieval algorithm for processing and analyzing optical pulses. It includes functions to calculate pulse width, error, time-bandwidth product, and various other utilities.

## Features

- **Trace Resampling**: Resamples and transforms coordinates for accurate trace representation.
- **Trace Denoise**: Applies multiple noise reduction techniques on FROG traces.
- **Trace Solver**: Iteratively solves for optimized traces using various algorithms.
- **Trace Margin Correct**: Corrects spectral margins of SHG FROG traces.
- **Trace Error**: Calculates the error between measured and simulated traces.
- **Trace Width Calculations**: Includes functions for full width, main width, and various specified widths of a pulse.
- **Time-Bandwidth Product (TBP)**: Calculates the TBP of a pulse using specified methods.
